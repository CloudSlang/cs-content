        Tests that get_failed_build.sl operation finishes with FAILURE
        Because of the Circleci API, even if the API key is wrong
        the response will return [] with a status code of 200 and SUCCESS
        The response should end with status code 401 and the message
        "You must login first"  since the API key is not valid
