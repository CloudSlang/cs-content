#! @description: This operation is used to iterate a list of values with the help of GlobalSessionObject in order to
#!               keep track of the last index. It is not recommended to modify the value of the "list" and "separator"
#!               inputs during the iteration process.
#!
#! @input list: The list to iterate through.
#! @input separator: A delimiter separating the list elements. This may be single character, multi-characters or special
#!                   characters.
#!                   Default: ','
#!
#! @output result_string: The current list element (if the response is "has more").
#! @output return_result: "has more" - Another value was found in the list and it has been returned,
#!                        "no more" - The iterator has gone through the entire list. This response is returned once per
#!                        list iteration,
#!                        "failure" - The operation completed unsuccessfully.
#! @output return_code: "0" if has more, "1" if no more values, and "-1" if failed.
#!
#! @result HAS_MORE: Another value was found in the list and it has been returned.
#! @result NO_MORE: The iterator has gone through the entire list. This response is returned once per list iteration.  A
#!                  subsequent call to the List iterator operation restarts the list iteration process.
#! @result FAILURE: The operation completed unsuccessfully.
