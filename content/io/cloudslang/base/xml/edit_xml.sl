#!!
#! @description: Edits an XML document.
#!
#! Examples:
#! 1. The following is a valid xpath example for working with a XML that uses default namespace.
#!    This example searches all "td" elements from the default namespace:
#!    xml: <table xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">
#!                <tr>
#!                    <td>Apples</td>
#!                    <td>Bananas</td>
#!                 </tr>
#!            </table>
#!    xpath1: //*[namespace-uri()="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" and name()="td"]
#!
#! Notes:
#! 1. For the delete action the following inputs are required: xml or filePath, xpath1, type and in case type is 'attr'
#!    then name is also required (representing the attributes name). Delete action modifies the XML only for type 'elem' or attr'.
#! 2. For the insert action the following inputs are required: xml or filePath, xpath1, value, type and in case type is 'attr'
#!    then name is also required (representing the attributes name). For type 'elem' insert adds the node before
#!    the resulting nodes of the XPath. For type 'text' insert adds the text before the text value of resulting nodes of the XPath.
#! 3. For the append action the following inputs are required: xml or filePath, xpath1, value, type and in case type is 'attr'
#!    then name is also required (representing the attributes name). For type 'elem' append adds the node after
#!    the resulting nodes of the XPath. For type 'text' append adds the text after the text value of resulting nodes of the XPath.
#! 4. For insert and append attributes the order is the default alphabetical.
#! 5. For the subnode action the following inputs are required: xml or filePath, xpath1 and value.
#! 6. For the move action the following inputs are required: xml or filePath, xpath1 and xpath2.
#!    Move  action  modifies the XML only for type 'elem'.
#! 7. For the rename action the following inputs are required: xml or filePath, xpath1, value, type and in case type is 'attr'
#!    then name is also required (representing the attributes name). Rename action  modifies the XML only for type 'elem' or attr'.
#! 8. For the update action the following inputs are required: xml or filePath, xpath1, value, type and in case type is 'attr'
#!    then name is also required (representing the attributes name).
#! 9. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) organization provides the XPath specification (http://www.w3.org).
#! 10. XML using default namespace is also supported by this operation.
#! 11. An element from the default namespace can be retrieved using a location path.
#!
#! @input xml: The XML (in the form of a String).
#!             Optional
#! @input file_path: Absolute or remote path of the XML file.
#!                   Optional
#! @input action: The edit action to take place.
#!                Valid: delete, insert, append, subnode, move, rename, update.
#! @input xpath_1: The XPath Query to be run. The changes take place at the resulting elements.
#! @input xpath_2: The XPath Query to be run. For the move action the results of xpath1 are moved to the results of xpath2.
#!                 Optional
#! @input value: The new value.
#!               Examples: <newNode>newNodeValue</newNode> , <newNode newAttribute="newAttributeValue">newNodeValue</newNode>, new value.
#!               Optional
#! @input type: Defines on what should the changes take effect.
#!              The element, the value of the element or the attributes of the element.
#!              Valid: elem, text, attr
#!              Optional
#! @input name: The name of the attribute in case the selected type is 'attr' .
#! @input parsing_features: The list of XML parsing features separated by new line (CRLF).
#!                          The feature name - value must be separated by empty space.
#!                          Setting specific features this field could be used to avoid XML security issues like
#!                          "XML Entity Expansion injection" and "XML External Entity injection".
#!                          To avoid aforementioned security issues we strongly recommend to set this input to the following values:
#!                          http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl true
#!                          http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities false
#!                          http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities false
#!                          When the "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl" feature is set to "true"
#!                          the parser will throw a FATAL ERROR if the incoming document contains a DOCTYPE declaration.
#!                          When the "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities" feature is set to "false"
#!                          the parser will not include external general entities.
#!                          When the "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities" feature is set to "false"
#!                          the parser will not include external parameter entities or the external DTD subset.
#!                          If any of the validations fails, the operation will fail with an error message describing the problem.
#!                          Default value:
#!                          http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl true
#!                          http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities false
#!                          http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities false
#!
#! @output return_result: This is the primary output. The edited XML.
#! @output return_code: 0 for success; -1 for failure.
#! @output exception: The exception message in case one occurred.
#!
#! @result SUCCESS: The operation completed as stated in the description.
#! @result FAILURE: The operation completed unsuccessfully.
