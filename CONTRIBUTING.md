# CloudSlang Contribution Guide

We welcome and encourage community contributions to CloudSlang.
Please familiarize yourself with the Contribution Guidelines and Project Roadmap before contributing.
There are many ways to help CloudSlang:
* Report issues
* Fix issues
* Improve the documentation


## Contributing Code

The best way to directly collaborate with the project contributors is through GitHub: https://github.com/CloudSlang.
* If you want to contribute to our code by either fixing a problem or creating a new feature, please open a GitHub pull request.
* If you want to raise an issue such as a defect, an enhancement request or a general issue, please open a GitHub issue.


Note that all patches from all contributors get reviewed.
After a pull request is made, other contributors will offer feedback. If the patch passes review, a maintainer will accept it with a comment.
When a pull request fails testing, the author is expected to update the pull request to address the failure until it passes testing and the pull request merges successfully.

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches (even patches from maintainers).

Content contributions which require environments that are difficult to setup
may be accepted as beta content. Beta content is not verified or tested by the
CloudSlang team. Beta content is named with the `beta_` prefix. The community
is encouraged to assist in setting up testing environments for the beta content.  

## Pull Requests
We encourage and support contributions from the community. No fix is too small. We strive to process all pull requests as soon as possible and with constructive feedback. If your pull request is not accepted at first, please try again after addressing the feedback you received.
To make a pull request you will need a GitHub account. For help, see GitHub's documentation on forking and pull requests. (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ )

Normally, all pull requests must include tests that test your change. Tests can be run using the CloudSlang Build Tool. To learn more about testing your content and using the Build Tool, see the [project documentation](http://www.cloudslang.io/#/docs). Occasionally, a change will be very difficult to test. In those cases, please include a note in your commit message explaining why tests are not included.

### Content Validation and Build Tool

When contributing new CloudSlang content or changing existing content, the content must be written according to our content best practices, which can be found in the [project documentation](http://www.cloudslang.io/#/docs).

All contributed CloudSlang content must pass our content validation and all tests must pass.

In order to test that your content passes validation and to run tests, follow the instructions for using the CloudSlang Build Tool in the [project documentation](http://www.cloudslang.io/#/docs).

##Conduct

Whether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you.

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all regardless of their background and the extent of their contributions.
Please avoid using nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
Be kind and courteous.
Those who insult, demean or harass anyone will be excluded from interaction. In particular, behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups will not be tolerated.
We welcome discussion about creating a welcoming, safe and productive environment for the community. If you have any questions, feedback or concerns please let us know. (info@cloudslang.io)
